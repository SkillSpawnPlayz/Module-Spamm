# Python Module: Spamm
A python module that contains 3 functions

The cool thing you can do is use a function called Up_d() , this function upgrades the module and make it spam using the keyboard instead.

the available functions:

# string(text) 

spams the text you want it to spam. (please dont add numbers in the string. please do print("text_here" + num_var/number_here )

# spamm( 1 - inf) 

spams the string - textin the console(if the module is not upgraded)  and spams in a selected text box and presses enter(if its upgraded THIS IS DANGEROUS. you can just do ctrl + c in the output area if you want to stop it)).

# up_d() 

upgrades the whole module and imports keyboard
